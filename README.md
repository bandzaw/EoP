Elements of Programming by Stepanov & McJones

## Introduction
During corona crisis in 2020, the company I work for sent home all employees tasked with "competence development". I decided to work my way through Elements of Programming.

I intend to document my progress here to some degree, whatever that means. Maybe that only means some notetaking, maybe some code to excercices and proof of theorems and lemmas.
